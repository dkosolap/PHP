<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class makes vectors and some additional calculations.
An instance of Vector can be constructed from array, which contains from:
dest - mandaytory object, an instance of Vertex class. This is destination
    of vector direction;
orig - optional. An instance of Vertex class, start of vector. Dy default
    this element installed as (0, 0, 0);
new Vector = (array('dest' => $vertex_dest, 'orig' => $vertex_orig) - vector
    will be constructed by 'dest' and 'orig'.
new Vector = (array('dest' => $vertex_dest) - vector will be constructed by
    dest and default value of 'orig'.
The class provides the following methods:
float   magnitude();
    Returns the length of vector.
Vector  normalize();
    Returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is already
    normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.
Vector  add( Vector $rhs );
    Returns the sum vector of current vector and $rhs.
Vector  sub( Vector $rhs );
    Returns the difference vector of current and $rhs vectors.
Vector  opposite();
    Returns the opposite vector to current.
Vector  scalarProduct( $k );
    Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.
float   dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
    Returns the scalar multiplication of both current and $rhs vectors.
float   cos( Vector $rhs );
    Returns the angleâ€™sAppendix cosine between both current and $rhs vectors.
Vector  crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
    Returns the cross multiplication of both current and $rhs vectors,
    calculated by "right-hand" mark.
